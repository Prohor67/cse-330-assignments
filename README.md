# Numerical Methods Course Notebooks

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks created as part of a course on Numerical Methods. Each notebook covers a fundamental topic in numerical analysis, with implementations, examples, and visualizations in Python.

## ðŸ“˜ Notebooks Overview

### 01_Polynomial_Interpolation.ipynb
Introduces the concept of polynomial interpolation. Demonstrates how to construct polynomials that pass through a given set of data points using basic interpolation methods.

### 02_Lagrange_Interpolation.ipynb
Focuses on Lagrange interpolation. Shows how to use the Lagrange basis polynomials to interpolate data, with implementations and comparisons to standard polynomial interpolation.

### 03_Hermite_and_Newtons_Divided_Difference.ipynb
Explores Hermite interpolation and Newton's Divided Difference method:
- Hermite interpolation handles repeated points and derivatives.
- Newtonâ€™s method provides an efficient way to construct interpolating polynomials recursively.

### 04_Differentiation_and_Richardson_Extrapolation.ipynb
Covers numerical differentiation:
- Forward, backward, and central differences
- Richardson extrapolation for increasing the accuracy of derivative estimates

### 05_Nonlinear_Equations.ipynb
Solves nonlinear equations using iterative numerical techniques:
- Bisection method
- Newton-Raphson method
- Secant method
Includes convergence analysis and error estimation.

### 06_Solving_linear_system.ipynb
Solves systems of linear equations using:
- Gaussian Elimination
- LU Decomposition
- Gauss-Seidel Iteration
Emphasizes computational efficiency and numerical stability.
